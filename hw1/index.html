<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

<p>Here is an example 2x2 gridlike structure using an HTML table. Each <b>tr</b> is a row and each <b>td</b> is a column in that row. You might find this useful for framing and showing your result images in an organized fashion.</p>
<p>In order to rasterize triangles, we have to approximate their shape on the pixel 
	grid that we have available to us. One way to do this is to take the point at 
	the center of each pixel as a sample, and check if that sample is inside the 
	triangle. If it is, then that pixel is “activated” and should be colored accordingly. 
</p>
<p>My algorithm works by first taking the bounding box of the triangle, 
	which is the minimum and maximum x and y values of the triangle, 
	which form a box that encloses the triangle. Then, I perform sampling once, 
	at the center of each pixel for all pixels within the bounding box. 
</p>
<p>Below we can see the result of that, with the pixel inspector focused on the 
	bottom of the pink triangle, where we can see two diagonal faces of a triangle meet. </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

<p>Supersampling is extremely useful because it allows us to modulate the 
	intensity of pixels. For pixels that are on the very edge of a triangle, 
	it seems unreasonable to color them with the same intensity as pixels 
	in the middle. By taking multiple samples at points inside a pixel, 
	we can increase or decrease the intensity of the color shown, based on 
	how many of these supersamples are activated by the triangle. 
	This helps to remove some of the aliasing effects caused by triangles 
	that are in a pixel but do not clip the exact center, or triangles that 
	are very skinny and clip the centers of many pixels that it does not 
	take up much room in. 
</p>
<p>My supersampling algorithm works by multiplying the size of the sample buffer 
	by the supersample rate. Then, once a bounding box is established, 
	I perform regular sampling, as if the pixel density is multiplied by the 
	supersampling rate. The main change occurs when consolidating the sample 
	buffer into the framebuffer. At this stage, I add an inner loop that loops 
	through all the samples within each pixel and averages the colors of these 
	supersamples into a single color for a pixel. This is then passed into the 
	framebuffer as normal. Thus, the only changes are to the sample buffer and 
	the downsampling for the framebuffer. 
</p>
<p>In the below images, we can see how increasing the sample rate, 
	makes some pixels around the edge of the triangle a lighter color. 
	This allows the triangle to fade into view, removing the hard edges 
	and jaggies. At a slight distance, the supersampled triangles look 
	significantly better.

  </div>

<p>My goal here was to move the arms of the cubeman in order to make it look like he was dancing. 
	I did this by bending the legs outwards, through rotation. 
	I then reveresed the rotation for the bottom half of the legs, 
	in order to make the illusion of bent knees. 
	I did something similar for the left arm, with a different degree of rotation. 
	I kept the right arm straight because it felt more dance-y, and I also kept the head rotated, 
	to make him seem a bit more dramatic. All of this is ultimately accomplished with rotations, 
	and it's worth noting that the rotations for lower limbs had to take into account the rotations for the upper parts of limbs, 
	because of how transformations cascade.

	<figcaption align="middle">Proportional Distances to Each Vertex</figcaption>

  </div>

<p>Barycentric coordinates are a set of numbers used to represent any point 
	P within a triangle. These coordinates are expressed as ratios of the 
	distance along the lines that are perpendicular to each edge of the triangle. 
	Barycentric coordinates are typically denoted by (α, β, γ), where α, β, and γ 
	represent the weights of the vertices of the triangle. In the image, we can 
	see how the point Z is a weighted sum of the values at the vertices. 
</p>
<p>To blend colors smoothly within a triangle using barycentric coordinates, 
	you would assign a color to each vertex of the triangle and then interpolate 
	the colors for each point within the triangle based on their barycentric 
	coordinates. The color at any point Z within the triangle can be calculated 
	by interpolating the colors of the triangle's vertices using the barycentric 
	coordinates of point Z.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

<p> Pixel sampling is a technique used to determine the color of a pixel 
	on an image. When rendering an image, colors and textures are represented 
	using discrete pixels. Pixel sampling determines the color of each pixel 
	based on the information from the colors and textures in the scene. For 
	instance, this is often done with barycentric interpolation. 
</p>
<p>Pixel sampling for texture mapping typically involves mapping texture 
	coordinates to the corresponding texels in the texture image and then 
	using either nearest neighbor or bilinear interpolation to determine 
	the color of pixels on the rendered surface based on the colors of the 
	texels. In the case of my implementation. I used barycentric interpolation 
	to determine α, β,  and γ weights for the point of interest, in texture 
	coordinates. I then determined a color using texture sampling, which was 
	added to the sample buffer. 
</p>
<p>Nearest neighbor sampling works by taking the color of the texel closest to 
	the one I’m looking at. Bilinear sampling works by linearly interpolating my 
	point with the two texels to the sides, and two texels above and below. 
	These are then interpolated once more in order to get a weighted sum of the 
	four closest points. This determines the color. 
</p>
<p>When the sample rate is low, bilinear does a better job of getting color 
	information from the surrounding space, which reduces aliasing in detailed 
	environments. At higher sample rates, these differences are more difficult 
	to notice because more frequent sampling is likewise able to reduce aliasing 
	in these environments. However, we can expect impressive results at a relatively 
	low cost of computation for bilinear with a low sampling rate.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

<p> Level sampling is used to improve the rendering quality and performance of 
	textured surfaces. It is particularly helpful when a texture is viewed at 
	different scales. It involves computing multiple versions of a texture at 
	different levels of detail (mipmaps), and then selecting the appropriate 
	mipmap based on the distance or scale at which the texture is viewed. 
	This helps to reduce aliasing. 
</p>
<p>For texture mapping, I computed my mipmap level as a floating point number, 
	based on the distance between pixels in texel space. In other words, if the 
	texture was highly stretched, the mipmap level would be higher, helping to 
	control aliasing in these circumstances. Based on the type of level sampling 
	technique, I calculated the appropriate color for the corresponding level 
	and used that to fill the sample buffer. 
</p>
<p>Level sampling takes more memory to store all the different mipmap levels, 
	however due to the convergence of infinite sums, the total memory overhead 
	is not significantly greater than a standard texture space. The antialiasing 
	power of mipmaps is significant, although the number of samples per pixel can 
	have an even greater impact. The downside with this technique is that speed 
	and memory get worse linearly with the increase in sample rate. Pixel sampling 
	techniques do not suffer from the same increases in memory and time complexity, 
	and depending on the technique used, it can also provide significant antialiasing. 
	All of these approaches have benefits and limitations, and can be used in 
	conjunction to derive the best approach for each application.
