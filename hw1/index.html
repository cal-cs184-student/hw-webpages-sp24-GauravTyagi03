<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

<p>Here is an example 2x2 gridlike structure using an HTML table. Each <b>tr</b> is a row and each <b>td</b> is a column in that row. You might find this useful for framing and showing your result images in an organized fashion.</p>
<p>In order to rasterize triangles, we have to approximate their shape on the pixel 
	grid that we have available to us. One way to do this is to take the point at 
	the center of each pixel as a sample, and check if that sample is inside the 
	triangle. If it is, then that pixel is “activated” and should be colored accordingly. 
</p>
<p>My algorithm works by first taking the bounding box of the triangle, 
	which is the minimum and maximum x and y values of the triangle, 
	which form a box that encloses the triangle. Then, I perform sampling once, 
	at the center of each pixel for all pixels within the bounding box. 
</p>
<p>Below we can see the result of that, with the pixel inspector focused on the 
	bottom of the pink triangle, where we can see two diagonal faces of a triangle meet. </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

<p>Supersampling is extremely useful because it allows us to modulate the 
	intensity of pixels. For pixels that are on the very edge of a triangle, 
	it seems unreasonable to color them with the same intensity as pixels 
	in the middle. By taking multiple samples at points inside a pixel, 
	we can increase or decrease the intensity of the color shown, based on 
	how many of these supersamples are activated by the triangle. 
	This helps to remove some of the aliasing effects caused by triangles 
	that are in a pixel but do not clip the exact center, or triangles that 
	are very skinny and clip the centers of many pixels that it does not 
	take up much room in. 
</p>
<p>My supersampling algorithm works by multiplying the size of the sample buffer 
	by the supersample rate. Then, once a bounding box is established, 
	I perform regular sampling, as if the pixel density is multiplied by the 
	supersampling rate. The main change occurs when consolidating the sample 
	buffer into the framebuffer. At this stage, I add an inner loop that loops 
	through all the samples within each pixel and averages the colors of these 
	supersamples into a single color for a pixel. This is then passed into the 
	framebuffer as normal. Thus, the only changes are to the sample buffer and 
	the downsampling for the framebuffer. 
</p>
<p>In the below images, we can see how increasing the sample rate, 
	makes some pixels around the edge of the triangle a lighter color. 
	This allows the triangle to fade into view, removing the hard edges 
	and jaggies. At a slight distance, the supersampled triangles look 
	significantly better.

<p>My goal here was to move the arms of the cubeman in order to make it look like he was dancing. 
	I did this by bending the legs outwards, through rotation. 
	I then reveresed the rotation for the bottom half of the legs, 
	in order to make the illusion of bent knees. 
	I did something similar for the left arm, with a different degree of rotation. 
	I kept the right arm straight because it felt more dance-y, and I also kept the head rotated, 
	to make him seem a bit more dramatic. All of this is ultimately accomplished with rotations, 
	and it's worth noting that the rotations for lower limbs had to take into account the rotations for the upper parts of limbs, 
	because of how transformations cascade.
